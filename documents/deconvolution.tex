\title{Inferring dust properties from 6-band \Herschel\ imaging
       but at the resolution of the highest resolution band (\PACS~$70\,\mum$)}
\author{MK, DL, DWH}

\begin{abstract}
In many astronomical projects, images or angular maps are built from
multi-wavelength imaging that is also multi-resolution:
Every wavelength is imaged at a different angular resolution.
One method for uniformizing the resolution is to convolve or blur the
images to a common (usually the lowest) resolution, discarding
information.
Of the alternative approaches, the best from an information-theory
perspective is to forward model the full stack of multi-band,
multi-resolution images, accounting for the unique, finite resolution
of each image.
To make the problem well-posed, the optimization or inference must be
regularized with prior information about what kinds of spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) are possible, and about the smoothness of the map.

Here we perform this forward modeling on \Herschel\ imaging of the
Andromeda Galaxy to map the dust at resolution of \Herschel's highest
resolution band.
We regularize the optimization with a simple model of dust emissivity.
We demonstrate that we can produce high-resolution dust density and
temperature maps, and make predictions for (hypothetical future)
higher-resolution infrared imaging.
We demonstrate the validity of the maps with cross-validation-like
tests of their predictive power.
We discuss limitations and extensions of the method, especially as
regards the flexibility of the SED model.
